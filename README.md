# PyC-C
A very basic command & control server with python socket and subprocess.
Just for fun x)

## Usage
Run the server.py on your local machine, and the payload.py on your target machine.

Using `pyInstaller` to create an executable is also possible.

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile payload.py
```

## TODO

I would like to add some spyware functionalities, without installing a lot of modules.

An upload function as an example.
